## Our Algorithm
Establish a cost that factors in available link capacity, shortest path and nodes SF capacity. Apply a set of hyper parameters that can be be used to affect the cost of sending a specific SFC to a node SN.

Cost = (a * ratio_link_capacity) + (b * cost_path) + (c * SF capacity)

Attempt to determine if there is a relationship between a given network and our ratio of hyper parameters.
